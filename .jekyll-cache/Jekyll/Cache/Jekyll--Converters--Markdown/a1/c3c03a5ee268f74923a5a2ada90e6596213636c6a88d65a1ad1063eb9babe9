I"†<p>Here is a little Python script that unzips files into folders with the same name in Linux. Take, for example, the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test.zip</code>. If it contains a number of files and you unzip using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unzip test.zip</code> on Linux, then they will all be decompressed into your present working directory. If you wanted the files to go into a folder bearing the prefix of zip file, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code>, then youâ€™d have to write a shell scriptâ€¦until now! Just because, I wrote a python script that does the same thing using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unar</code>. Now, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unar</code> can do this for one file but not for several, e.g. as defined using a wildcar <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.zip</code>. My script, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unzipr</code> (because every Python script needs a fancy name), does just this. Please feel free to use and pass along if you find it helpful!</p>
