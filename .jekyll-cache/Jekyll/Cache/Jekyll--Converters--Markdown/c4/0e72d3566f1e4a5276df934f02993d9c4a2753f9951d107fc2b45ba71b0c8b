I"n<p>This notebook outlines how to visualize the dipolar structure of 10% Sr-doped (Ba,Sr)TiO3 from bond valence molecular dynamics (BVMD) simulations. This recipe could be used to visualize the dynamics of any atom-centered vector property, e.g. magnetic moment, molecular orientation, etc. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.</p>
