I"÷<p>If youâ€™re running MD simulations, then this is the post for you. It can sometimes be a nightmare to compress MD trajectories because they can be so large, like multiple GBs (or maybe even TBs if youâ€™re working with gigantic systems). Up until now, Iâ€™ve found myself deleting MD trajectors but saving a restart file so that I can regenerate the data if I need to do further processing. This can be somewhat of a drag so I went searching for a way to compress MD trajectories in parallel. Thatâ€™s when I came across <a href="https://zlib.net/pigz/">pigz</a>. If you already know how to make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tar.gz</code> file, then it is really easy to use pigz. For example, the pigz command corresponding to</p>
