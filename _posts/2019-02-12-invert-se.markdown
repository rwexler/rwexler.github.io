A few days ago, I had to write a section of my thesis on pseudopotentials. In the Rappe group, we use designed nonlocal, optimized, norm-conserving pseudopotentials. That's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

*Norm-conserving*

This means two things. First, that the integral under the tail of the pseudo-wave functions (approximate) is equal to that of the all-electron wave functions (more exact). Mathematically speaking, this looks like

$$a x^{2} + b x + c = 0$$

(Under construction...)
