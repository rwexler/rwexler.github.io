<p>A few days ago, I had to write a section of my thesis on pseudopotentials. In the Rappe group, we use designed nonlocal, optimized, norm-conserving pseudopotentials. That’s a mouthful. Let’s break it down.</p>

<p><em>Norm-conserving</em></p>

<p>This means two things. First, that the integral under the tail of the pseudo-wave functions (approximate) is equal to that of the all-electron wave functions (more exact). Mathematically speaking, this looks like</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a x^{2} + b x + c = 0</script>

<p>(Under construction…)
(I will get back to this soon, I promise!)</p>
