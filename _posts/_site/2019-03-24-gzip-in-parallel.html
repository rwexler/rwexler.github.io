<p>If you are running MD simulations, then this is the post for you. It can sometimes be a nightmare to compress MD trajectories because they can be so large, like multiple GBs (or maybe even TBs if you’re working with gigantic systems). Up until now, I have found myself deleting MD trajectors but saving a restart file so that I can regenerate the data if I need to do further processing. This can be somewhat of a drag so I went searching for a way to compress MD trajectories in parallel. That’s when I came across <a href="https://zlib.net/pigz/">pigz</a>. If you already know how to make a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tar.gz</code> file, then it is really easy to use pigz. For example, the pigz command corresponding to</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar zcvf &lt;filename&gt;.tar.gz &lt;filename/directory_name/etc&gt;</code></p>

<p>is</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar cvf - &lt;filename/directory_name/etc&gt; | pigz -n &lt;number_cores&gt; &lt;filename&gt;.tar.gz</code></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
