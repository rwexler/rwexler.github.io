My name is Rob and I'm currently a PhD candidate in chemistry at UPenn. I got my BS in chemistry (with a minor in music) at Drexel across the street. Generally speaking, I am interested in applying first principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to model a wide variety of material systems such as catalysts and ferroelectrics/relaxors. As a chemist, I enjoy studying everything from gas and solution phase molecules to inorganic crystals. Recently, I have also become interested in finding ways to more efficient generate surface phase diagrams using ab initio thermodynamics. To this end, my colleagues at Penn and I developed a software package that performs ab initio grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, which can be used to sample thermodynamically relevant surface phases. In the future, we are hoping to make this algorithm more general and efficient so that it can be applied to study a wide range of phenomena like surface hydration or quantum dot growth at different length scales.

Besides my chemistry work, I am an avid musician and lover of music. I can't get enough of *early* Elton John and Ben folds. I have a mini-recording studio set up in the back room of my apartment where I record vocals, piano, guitar, bass, and drums (using a keyboard that is) all by myself. I'll post some pictures of the space in the near future. Also, if you search the web hard enough, you may just find some of my recordings and music videos.

I created this web page so that I could keep track of all the cool softwares, papers, and derivations/tutorials I have either used or designed/written myself. I hope that this can be a useful resource for those of you in the world of computational materials science and if you have any questions, recommendations for content, or just want to say hi, please feel free to message me on any of these platforms ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertwexler/), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Wexler), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robertowexler)) or write me an email at `rwexler@sas.upenn.edu`.
