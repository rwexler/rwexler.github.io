At the ACS conference this year (2019) in Orlando, I saw some talks about analyzing publically available chemistry datasets. However, there doesn't seem to be a central repository of chemistry data sets. As such, I have charged myself with doing so. Please inform me if you know of any datasets that I have neglected (my apologies!).

* [PubChemPy](https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Python tool for interacting with the PubChem database
* [ChemSpiPy](https://chemspipy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Python tool for interacting with the ChemSpider database
* [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) - database containing protein sequence and functional information
* [mendeleev](https://pypi.org/project/mendeleev/) - Python tool for accessing elemental properties
* [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) - general-purpose tool for analyzing chemical data
* [pyEQL](https://github.com/rkingsbury/pyEQL) - Python tool for accessing the properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions
* [The Harvard organic photovoltaic dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201686) - experimental and quantum-mechanical PV data
* [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) - Python tool for cheminformatics and ML
* [Neural Graph Fingerprints](https://github.com/HIPS/neural-fingerprint) - specialized CNNs for predicting the properties of molecules
* [Covariant Compositional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02144) - another specialized CNNs for molecules
* [ChemML](https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemml/) - another Python tool for cheminformatics and ML
